# AniMatic

* To use this script drop it into an "Editor" folder in your project

* Select some pdb textures then access the script using the Right Click menu

* It will load the textures into the correct channels on the new material

* To customize the script for your texture naming change the names of the strings with the comments

<  if(item.name.Contains("Base_Color") || item.name.Contains("Albedo")) >

* So if your albedo files are just named "Color" chage the "Base_Color" to "Color" etc
* Do this with the rest of the channels

* YEH YEH its still faster then without this script maaaaaaaaaaan
